<h2>👨‍💻 CyberSecurity Projects:</h2>


-UFC Stats Puller(Web Scraper) 
This project scrapes data from the UFCStats website using Python and BeautifulSoup, and outputs the stats of all fighters into a CSV file. The data includes each fighter's first and last name, nickname (if any), height, weight, reach, stance, wins, losses, draws, and belt. The program can be run with a single command and the resulting file can be used for further analysis. This project showcases web scraping, data processing, and file I/O skills, and can serve as a starting point for exploring UFC fighter stats or similar websites.
  
  -Cyber Threat Intelligence: Cyber threat intelligence is becoming increasingly important for organizations to stay ahead of potential cyber threats. Conducting research on emerging cyber threats and developing threat intelligence reports would be a great way to demonstrate your knowledge and expertise in this area.
  
 -Application Security: With the increasing amount of software used in all industries, application security has become a top concern. Conducting research on emerging application security threats and vulnerabilities, or developing secure coding practices and tools for software developers, would be a valuable project to include on your resume.
